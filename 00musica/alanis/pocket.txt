Sol
I'm broke but I'm happy, I'm sore but I'm kind
I'm short but I'm healthy, yeah
I'm high but I'm grounded, I'm sane but I'm overwhelmed
I'm lost but I'm hopeful, baby

Land what it all comes down to
Is that ev'rything's gonna be quite alright
Doause I got one hand in my pocket
Land the other one is flickin' a cigarette

Land what it all comes down to
Is that I haven't got it all figured out just yet
Doause I got one hand in my pocket
Land the other one is givin' a peace sign
Verse:
 	-----
 	        I'm free but I'm focused, I'm green but I'm wise
I'm hard but I'm friendly, baby
I'm sad but I'm laughin', I'm brave but I'm chickenshit
I'm sick but I'm pretty, baby

Land what it all boils down to
Is that no one's really got it figured out just yet
Well I got one hand in my pocket
Land the other one is playin' a piano

Land what it all comes down to, my friend, yeah
Is that everything is just fine, fine, fine
Doause I got one hand in my pocket
Land the other one is hailing a taxi cab
