The Unforgiven - Metallica

LAm                   Mim        re              LAm
New blood joins this earth  and quickly he's sub-dued.
                         mim        re                      LAm
Through constant pain disgrace, the young boy learns their rules.
                          mim      re                LAm
With time the child draws in this whipping boy done wrong.
                     mim          re                  LAm
Deprived of all his thoughts, the young man struggles on and  on.
                   do            sol      do              sol
He knows,  oo, a  vow unto  his own that never from this day
      do                   sol  mi
 his will they'll take a - way.


[Chorus]

 LAm       do              sol         mim                         LAm
What I've felt, what I've known never shined through in what I've shown.
 LAm  do         sol        mi                  LAm
Never be. Never see. Won't see what might have been.
 LAm       do              sol         mim                         LAm
What I've felt, what I've known,never shined through in what I've shown.
 LAm   do         sol      mi           LAm
Never free. Never me. So I dub the unforgiven.


[Verse]

 LAm                 mim      re            LAm
They dedicate their lives to running all of his
                        mim        re           LAm
He tries to please them all, this bitter man he is
                         mim        re            LAm
Throughout the life the same, he's battled constantly
                      mim    re             LAm
This fight he cannot win. A tired man they see no longer cares.
     do           sol         do          solG
The old man then prepares to die regretfully
      do             sol mi
That old man here is me.

 Am    C          G        E            Am
Never free. Never me. So I dub the unforgiven.

I'm not sure about the G just before the E at the end of the verse, though.

And for people who like to play chords and sing, try adding in the little intro pattern.
