Verse:                                                          
      Do                 Lam                                            Do                 Lam                                              
I've heard there was a secret chord                               There was a time you let me know                                          
      Do                      Lam                                       Do              Lam                                                 
That david played and it pleased the Lord                         What's really going on below                                              
     Fa                Sol              Do          Sol                Fa              Sol         Do               Sol                     
but you don't really care for music, do you?                      but now you never show it to me, do you?                                  
    Do                   Fa           Sol                              Do             Fa       Sol                                          
It goes like this, the fourth, the fifth                          I remember when I moved in you                                            
     Lam                Fa                                             Lam                       Fa                                         
The minor fall, the major lift                                    and the holy dove was moving too                                         
     Sol                Mim            Lam                             Sol               Mim            Lam                                 
The baffled king composing Hallelujah                             and every breath we drew was Hallelujah                                  
      Fa           Lam           Fa           Do  Sol Do    Sol         Fa           Lam           Fa           Do  Sol Do    Sol           
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelu - jah                 Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelu - jah                         
      Do                 Lam                                            Do                 Lam                                              
Your faith was strong, but you needed proof                       Maybe there's a god above,                                              
      Do              Lam                                               Do                 Lam                                              
You saw her bathing on the roof                                   all I ever learned from love                                              
     Fa              Sol         Do               Sol                  Fa                Sol              Do          Sol                   
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you                        Was how to shoot at someone who out drew you                              
     Do             Fa       Sol                                      Do                   Fa           Sol                                 
She tied you to a kitchen chair                                   and it's not a cry you can hear at night                                 
     Lam                       Fa                                      Lam                Fa                                                
She broke your throne, she cut your hair                          It's not somebody who's seen the light                                
     Sol               Mim            Lam                              Sol                Mim            Lam                              
and from your lips she drew the Hallelujah                        It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah

      Do                 Lam                                          
baby I've been here before,                    
      Do                      Lam

     Fa                Sol              Do          Sol

Love is not a victory march                                     
     Sol                Mim            Lam                             
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelu - jah               








                                                                
Siaby I've been here before, I know this room                    
I've walked this floor                                          
I used to live alone before I knew you                          
I've seen your flag on the Marble Larch                          
Love is not a victory march                                     
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah                        
                                                                
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelu - jah               
                                                                
There was a time you let me know                                
What's really going on below                                    
Siut now you never show it to me, do you?                        
I remember when I moved in you                                  
Land the holy dove was moving too                                
Land every breath we drew was Hallelujah                         
                                                                
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelu - jah               
                                                                
Maybe there's a Solod above, all I ever learned from love         
Was how to shoot at someone who out drew you                    
Land it's not a cry you can hear at night                        
It's not somebody who's seen the light                          
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah                        
                                                                
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelu - jah               
                                                                
                                                                
Take care,

etra original:                                                                                                          
                                                        He oído que existe un acorde secreto                            
Now I’ve heard there was a secret chord                 que David solía tocar, y que agradaba                           
That David played, and it pleased the Lord              al Señor.                                                       
But you don’t really care for music, do you?            Pero tú realmente no le das mucha                               
It goes like this                                       importancia a la música, ¿verdad?                               
The fourth, the fifth                                   Era algo así como la cuarta, la quinta                          
The minor fall, the major lift                          cae la menor y sube la mayor.                                   
The baffled king composing Hallelujah                   El rey, confundido, componiendo un aleluya.                     
                                                                                                                        
Hallelujah…                                             Aleluya…                                                        
                                                                                                                        
Your faith was strong but you needed proof              Tu fé era fuerte, pero necesitabas una prueba.                  
You saw her bathing on the roof                         La viste bañarse en el tejado.                                  
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew her              Su belleja, y el brillo de la luna, te superaron.               
She tied you                                            Te ató a la silla de su cocina.                                 
To a kitchen chair                                      Rompió tu trono, y cortó tu pelo.                               
She broke your throne, and she cut your hair            Y de tus labios arrancó un aleluya.                             
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah                                                                              
                                                        Aleluya…                                                        
Hallelujah…                                                                                                             
                                                        Dices que tomé su nombre en vano.                               
You say I took the name in vain                         No conozco siquiera su nombre.                                  
I don’t even know the name                              Pero si lo hice, bueno, realmente, ¿qué significa para tí?      
But if I did, well really, what’s it to you?            Hay un resplandor de luz                                        
There’s a blaze of light                                en cada palabra.                                                
In every word                                           No importa la que hayas oído.                                   
It doesn’t matter which you heard                       La sagrada o la rota. Aleluya.                                  
The holy or the broken Hallelujah                                                                                       
                                                        Aleluya…                                                        
Hallelujah…                                                                                                             
                                                        Hice lo mejor posible, no fue mucho.                            
I did my best, it wasn’t much                           No podía sentir, así que intenté tocar.                         
I couldn’t feel, so I tried to touch                    Dije la verdad, no te tomé el pelo.                             
I’ve told the truth, I didn’t come to fool you          Y aún así                                                       
And even though                                         todo salió mal.                                                 
It all went wrong                                       Permaneceré ante la oración del Señor,                          
I’ll stand before the Lord of Song                      sin nada en mi lengua más que el aleluya.                       
With nothing on my tongue but Hallelujah

Hallelujah…








































Aleluya…

Well your faith was strong but you needed proof           Bueno, tu fé era fuerte, pero necesitabas una prueba.                
You saw her bathing on the roof                           La viste bañarse en el tejado.

Hallelujah…                                               Aleluya…                                                             
                                                                                                                               
Baby i’ve been here before                                Cariño ya he estado aquí antes.                                      
I’ve seen this room and i’ve walked this floor            He visto ésta habitación y he caminado sobre éste suelo.             
I used to live alone before i knew you                    Solía vivir solo antes de conocerte.                                 
I’ve seen your flag on the marble arch                    He visto tu bandera sobre el arco de mármol,                         
But love is not a victory march                           pero el amor no es una marcha victoriosa.                            
It’s a cold and it’s a broken hallelujah                  Es un frío y roto aleluya.                                           
                                                                                                                               
Hallelujah…                                               Aleluya…                                                             
                                                                                                                               
Well there was a time when you let me know                Bueno, hubo un tiempo en que me dejabas saber                        
What’s really going on below                              que era lo que realmente sucedía allá abajo.                         
But now you never show that to me do you                  Pero ahora nunca me lo enseñas.                                      
But remember when i moved in you                          Pero recuerda cuando me uní a tí,                                    
And the holy dove was moving too                          cuando la paloma blanca volaba también,                              
And every breath we drew was hallelujah                   y cuando cada suspiero que dibujábamos era un aleluya.               
                                                                                                                               
Hallelujah…                                               Aleluya…                                                             
                                                                                                                               
Well, maybe there’s a god above                           Bueno, quizá haya un dios allá arriba.                               
But all i’ve ever learned from love                       Pero todo lo que he aprendido sobre el amor                          
Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew you                 fue cómo dispararle a alguien que ha desenfundado más rápido.        
It’s not a cry that you hear at night                     No es un lamento que oigas por la noche.                             
It’s not somebody who’s seen the light                    No es nadie que haya visto la luz.                                   
It’s a cold and it’s a broken hallelujah                  Es un frio y roto aleluya.                                           
                                                                                                                               
Hallelujah…                                               Aleluya…
