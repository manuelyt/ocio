 Another turning point, a fork stuck in the road                            
 Time grabs you by the wrist, directs you where to go                       
 So make the best of this test, and don't ask why                           
 It's not a question, but a lesson learned in time                          

It's something unpredictable, but in the end it's right.                    
I hope you had the time of your life.                                       
                                                                            
 So take the photographs, and still frames in your mind                     
 Hang it on a shelf in good health and good time                            
 Tattoos of memories and dead skin on trial                                 
 For what it's worth it was worth all the while
