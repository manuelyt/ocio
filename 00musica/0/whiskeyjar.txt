sol mi m do sol - re do sol

As I was going over - The Cork and Kerry mountains
I saw Captain Farrell - And his money he was counting
I first produced my pistol - And then produced my rapier
I said "Stand and deliver - Or the devil he may take you"

I took all of his money - And it was a pretty penny
I took all of his money and - I brought it home to Molly
She swore that she loved me - No Never would she leave me
But the devil take that woman - For you know she tricked me easy

Musha rain dum-A-do dum-A-da
Whack for my daddy-
Whack for my daddy-o
There`s Whiskey in the jar, o

Being drunk and weary - I went to Molly`s chamber
Taking my Molly with me - But I never knew the danger
For about six or maybe seven - In walked Captain Farrell
I jumped up, fired my pistols - And I shot him with both barrels

Musha rain dum-A-do dum-A-da
Whack for my daddy-
Whack for my daddy-o
There`s Whiskey in the jar, o

Now some men like the fishing - And some men like fowling
And some men like to hear, - To hear the cannonball a-roaring
Me - I like sleeping - Especially in my Molly`s chamber
But here I am in prison, - Here I am with a ball and chain, yeah

Musha rain dum-A-do dum-A-da
Whack for my daddy-
Whack for my daddy-o
There`s Whiskey in the jar, o
