--- re do sol
Seagull you fly across the horizon
Into the misty morning sun
Nobody asked you where you are going
Nobody knows where you are from

There is a man asking a question
Is this really the end of the world
Seagull you must have known for a long time
The shape of things to come

--- re do fa sol re
Now you fly to the sky, never asking why
You fly all around until somebody shoots you down

Seagull you fly across the horizon
Into the misty morning sun
Nobody asked you where you are going
Nobody knows where you are from

Now you fly to the sky, never asking why
You fly all around until somebody shoots you down

And you fly away today
You fly away tomorrow
Seagull go on and fly
Leave me to my sorrow

Fly, fly, go on and fly
